      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, it is October 14th 2020. This is my first site. I have been a Support Analyst for four years and I have finally decided to become a Software Engineer. I have decided to begin this journey on my own. I know it will be harder than going to school but I am also determined to stay away from debt. I will be relentless in my pursuit to become an Engineer. Remember to always celebrate the small wins and learn from what I’m sure will be many failures. I believe in myself!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have been born a raised in California, lived in many IE cities but currently reside in Rancho Cucamonga.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have many hobbies and it seems that every month I find a different one. Out of all my hobbies the top three have to be Football (Real circular ball and using only your feet FOOTball), Home Projects (Woodworking etc.), and Automotive Repairs.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software Engineer & Developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Rancho Cucamonga.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Since I can remember I’ve always wanted to be an Engineer that builds something. I’ve always grappled with the broadness of that description but as I’ve learned more about who I am and my wide range of interests/hobbies I uncovered something about myself. I am unable to be an Engineer in multiple disciplines, but I can focus on becoming an Engineer in one and make hobbies out of the reset. Software & Development has always been one of my top options, with my educational background in Information Management and experience in IT this is the obvious choice. Now that I have started to learn coding and terminology it has sparked an interest in this disciple and I’m excited to learn more.</p>
